    "An abstract class enforces rules about methods and properties that must be implemented, and it is useful to programmers who want to **make assertions on the methods and properties** that must be implemented on subclass. Abstract base classes allow preexisting classes to be registered as belonging to that base. When a class is registered with an abstract base, type-checking operations involving the abstract base will return *True* for instances of the registered class.  "
