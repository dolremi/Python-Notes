    "## program structure\n",
    "Python programs are structured as a sequence of statements. All language features are statements that have equal status with all other statements. When *loading source files*, the interpreter always **executes every statement** in order until there are no more statements to execute. <br>\n",
    "### Iteration\n",
    "If an object supports iterations, it should have those methods:\n",
    "* It must provide a method, *obj.__iter__()* returns an iterator object *iter*\n",

    "An object, *s*, supports iteration if it can be used with the following code, which mirrors the implementation of the **for** statement:"
